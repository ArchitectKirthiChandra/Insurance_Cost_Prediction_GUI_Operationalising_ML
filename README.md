# Insurance_Cost_Prediction_GUI_Operationalising_ML
 Developed a machine learning-powered tool with a graphical user interface to predict charges
Developed a GUI tool using Python and Tkinter that operationalizes a machine learning pipeline using joblib to predict insurance charges based on the following predictors:

Age
Gender
BMI
Smoker status
Number of children
The tool allows users to enter their information into the GUI and then click a button to predict their insurance charges. The tool uses a machine learning pipeline that has been trained on a dataset of historical insurance claims data. The pipeline includes the following steps:

Data preprocessing: This step cleans and transforms the data to prepare it for machine learning.
Feature engineering: This step creates new features from the existing data that may be more predictive of insurance charges.
Model training: This step trains a machine learning model on the prepared data.
Model evaluation: This step evaluates the performance of the trained model on a held-out test set.
Model serialization: This step saves the trained model to a file so that it can be used to make predictions on new data.
The tool uses the joblib library to load the trained model and make predictions. The tool also uses the Tkinter library to create the GUI.

The tool is a valuable tool for insurance companies and individuals who want to estimate their insurance charges. The tool is easy to use and provides accurate predictions.
